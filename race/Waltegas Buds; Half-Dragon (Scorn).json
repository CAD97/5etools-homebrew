Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage 1d8} Necrotice damage and any creatures they attack have resistance to Cold, Fire, Acid, Poison, and Lightning damage for the duration of that attack. They may repeat this save at the end of each of their turns to end this effect.
